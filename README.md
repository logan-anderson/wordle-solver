# Wordle Solver

A very bad wordle solver to help me solve the daily wordle on https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

## TODO list
- take into account letters not in the correct position (but are in the word)
- better picking of words (maybe ML?), Maybe pick words with more common letters at first (might have to come up with a heuristic) 


## Results

### Day 1

Wordle 219 5/6
### Day 2

Wordle 220 5/6


### Day 3
